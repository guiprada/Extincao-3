------------------------------ todo

- grid.load and grid.init should be unified
- Ghost Class derived from GridActor
- GeneticGhost Class derived from Ghost
- grid and others should auto init
- message bus

-- maybe we should support a multiloader gamestate system
    - gamestate multiloader system
    - particle generator gamestate

- collision notification with function call or message

- basic color system using unpack
- Particle should have color options

- camera system
- bigger than screen grids
- progressive level up system
- grid editor
- grid creating blocks and combining functions

-- ghosts overhaul
    - population saving and restoring system
    - fix reporter
    - Player bot based on evolutionary neural network
    - new action based ghost( depends on automatic player for testing)
    - ghosts should use function pointer for actions intead of ifs

- use predefined functions to select options behavior

- where module settings should be?

- procedure generated audio clips

- metabolism based speed
- metabolism based respawning

- analytics

- improve rotation animation by rotating with cornering relay
- create a grid_size agnostic positioning system, based on grid cell + some incell drift based on
  grid_size fraction to allow grid_size switching on the fly

----- on pills
- fitness based on distance to the average of the group of pills positions, so they are borne closer
- and how many ghosts have gone through then, so they are harder to catch, this may be uneed because
- coevolution may do that already

- two pills species, one rarer and stronger and are born further
